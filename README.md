# FinneEngine

FinneEngine is an experimental C++ network-oriented engine prototype.  
It's built for **learning and testing purposes only** ‚Äì primarily focused on working with configuration files, randomization, and simulating basic network identifiers.

## üì¶ What it does

- Loads simple configuration from XML (`Engine.xml`) using [tinyxml2](https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2).
- Generates random IDs to simulate server behavior.
- Simulates network components (but **does not connect** to any real network).
- Contains internal components like `FinnecoreGet(...)`, which are placeholders for future logic.

## ‚ùå What it **does NOT** do

- ‚ùå Does not connect to the internet  
- ‚ùå Does not modify system files or processes  
- ‚ùå Does not act as malware  
- ‚ùå Does not contain any form of exploit or hack  
- ‚ùå Does not collect data or communicate externally

This is an **educational / experimental engine**, NOT intended for malicious use.
